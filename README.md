# Question 1
Estimates
N0 = 986           
r = 0.01        
K = 6e10

# Question 2
At t = 4980 minutes the population size under exponential growth is estimated to be approximately 4.19Ã—10 ^24
In contrast, under logistical growth the population reaches a carrying capacity of 6.00x10^10 at around t = 2000
